# UCI Coding Bootcamp
## Portfolio ver 1.0.0

### Decription
A first version of a future full stack developer portfolio. Stylistically meant to look like a retro Terminal. Project names are ideas and currently only link to my github.


### Installation
Link to the deployed application can be found [here](https://google.com "Portfolio Challenge").

### Usage
Navigte to the deployed project. Links for Projects link back to github for now. Page should look like this:

### Features
Basic layout for first submit but planned features inclue:
* Animation for banner using SVG
* Card flip for projects that will contain info on projects
* overlay to draw CRT lines over the entire page
* glow effects for hover over text to mimic how it might look on a CRT
* fix banner text so it uses a "< pre > tag and not an image, but is still responsive.
* optimize for larger screens
* Actual info in the about me section
